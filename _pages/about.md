I am Barış, a Research Associate at Fermilab and SQMS National Quantum Center. I did my PhD research on Theory and Simulations of Interacting Quantum Systems at UW–Madison. I have extensive experience in full-stack quantum computing, from quantum algorithms to physical implementation. I have been collaborating with partners from academia, industry, national labs on emerging technologies, with the emphasis on quantum computing and artificial intelligence, building connections between quantum algorithms and hardware through quantum control stack.

I do “full-stack” science, covering all aspects of science communication. In addition to writing papers, research & grant proposals and giving invited talks; I have contributed to the community by mentoring interns from all levels (from students to professors) and by leadership in community-building.
