I am Barış, a research associate at Fermilab. My research focuses on hardware simulations and machine learning accelerators for scalable quantum control. I have extensive experience in all aspects of control stack between algorithms and physical implementation. I have been working on ways to expand the simulation and algorithmic capabilities of high-dimensional (multilevel, i.e., qudit-based) quantum computing at Fermilab.
